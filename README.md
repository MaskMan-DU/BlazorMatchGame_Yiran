# BlazorMatchGame_Yiran

I think my program has met all three improvements A, B, and C.

Improvement A:

In the program, I add a variable to record the high scores of the game and refresh the recorded scores when the user achieves a higher score. If the score is lower than the recorded score, then the score will not be updated.

And this feature is fully implemented.

Improvement B:

In the program I added game difficulty buttons, different difficulty level buttons correspond to different game countdown time, and users can choose different difficulty level buttons to change the game countdown time.

And this feature is fully implemented.

Improvement C:

In addition, in the program, I set the user to gain a point when a match is correct and lose a point when a match is incorrect.

And this feature is fully implemented.

Extra Improvement：

1. I changed the game timer to countdown. I want to show "You lose" when the countdown is over, then the game will reset

And the feature is fully implemented.

2.  I made the images for all 16 buttons are the same and the player only sees the "shuffled animal" image after they click on a button

And the feature is fully implemented.
